		<p> 
		My favorite hobbies are cinema 🎬, blogging 📱, design (canva, painting, home decoration 🎨) and fashion 👜. 
		I love watching all types of movies and series (excpet horror ones) and I am indeed in the process of lauching my own blog which will talk about fashion, selfcare and home decoration/organisation 🤩.

		<h2>Cinema 🎥</h2>
		<p>
			since I was a child, I have always been very interested in cinema, from animated films to fantastic ones up to historical films. It’s a way to relax or learn more about some things sometimes.

		<h2>Blogging 💻</h2>
		<p>
			since the summer of 2021, I decided to launch the creation of a website: a blog, on which I would talk about topics that interest me such as fashion, decoration/design or selfcare for example.

		<h2>design 🎨</h2>
		<p>
			I love having fun with shapes, colors and visual representations. and the site I use the most for fun or to create school projects is CANVA. I think I’m pretty good at it.I also love the interior decoration and the organization in a house. Without it I can not be comfortable at home.

	<div class="box-white">
		<h2>Fashion 🛍</h2>
		<p>
			I said I like to play with colors, shapes and visual aspect. I don’t do that only with CANVA, it also goes through fashion, I think it’s a very important element that allows many people to express themselves.I find it important enough to want to talk about it on the blog that I’m lauching.
